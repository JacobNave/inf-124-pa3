# Requirements Met

1) We were able to reimplement our home page and selected two java servlets to reimplement using jsp. The ones that we chose were specific to the about servlet and the orders servlet.
- If you look in our directory, you will see that there are many sections in the code where we changed a servlet to JSP. Several examples are the about.jsp, the product.jsp, and the orders.jsp. A majority of these changes still dynamically generate the data from the back end but now it's in JSP form instead of a java servlet.\

2) We were able to get Ajax working in one section of the project, which is specifically the form section where we are dynmically generating the values when we enter the zipcode.
- Going in the form to checkout, you can verify this by testing it out with a valid zipcode and seeing it auto populate. We were only able to fulfil 1 requirement and not the other.

3) No extra credit done
