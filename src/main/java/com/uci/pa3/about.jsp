      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <h3>
        We are a small team of Software Engineers Majors who started this
        business virtually from a classroom at UCI during the pandemic.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Due to the pandemic, computer parts began to explode in price making it
        difficult to buy affordable PC parts or computers in general.

      <h3>
        Our Mission is to end the price inflations and become a Ecommerce
        company that provides <strong> *NEW* </strong> PC parts and Computers at
        MSRP.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        We plan to scale our company to a multinational level and become a
        reliable computer hardware corporation selling these products.
